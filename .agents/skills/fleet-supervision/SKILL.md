## 8. Supervision protocol

Fleet supervision is an always-loaded operational contract; `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/turnend-guard.md`, the emitted session-start block, and script help own mechanisms and harness-specific recipes.

- Whenever work is under way, keep exactly one live supervision cycle using the emitted protocol for this primary harness.
- Relay may require that same live cycle with no fleet work.
- Do not substitute another harness's wait shape, use shell `&`, or create a second cycle when a healthy one already exists.
- For every actionable wake, follow the ordinary-wake continuation in the emitted protocol; use its repair action only when the live cycle is missing or failed.
- No turn ends blind while work is under way, including turns described as holding or waiting.

At the start of every wake-handling turn, drain the durable wake queue before peeking, reading beyond the reason line, steering, or starting work.
Session start is the only exception because its one-shot digest already presented the queue while locked or deliberately left it untouched in lock-refused read-only mode.
Treat any `OPEN DECISIONS` section from the drain as actionable reconciliation input even when no wake record was queued.
Treat any `UNREAD STATUS` section as newly surfaced status that must be read this turn; those lines are not re-printed after this presentation.
Treat any `RECORD DIVERGENCE` section as a contradiction between two records of one captain call, never as proof the captain ruled; load `captain-hold-lifecycle` and reconcile it in whichever direction the evidence supports.
After handling all emitted wakes and reconciling the OPEN DECISIONS and UNREAD STATUS sections, run the exact generation-bound `--ack-through` command printed as `WAKE_ACK_REQUIRED`; interruption before that acknowledgement deliberately leaves the work durable for idempotent re-handling.
A status line is a wake event, not current state; use `bin/fm-crew-state.sh` when current state matters, especially before re-escalating an old decision, blocker, or pause.
A declared `paused:` event means a bounded external wait expected to clear on its own, while `blocked:` means firstmate action is needed.

Handle actionable wakes as follows:

1. For `signal:`, read the listed event lines first, then reconcile current state only where action depends on it.
2. For `stale:`, inspect the recorded endpoint and load `stuck-crewmate-recovery` for a stopped, looping, confused, or unresponsive worker; a deep-inspection reason also requires current-state and validation-log inspection.
3. For `check:`, act on the named poll result, including merges, contribution signals, Relay events, process-to-event source results, and captain inbox notes; a handled inbox note is also acknowledged with `bin/fm-inbox.sh drain --ack <id>`, or it stays counted as still waiting for firstmate.
4. For `heartbeat:`, review the whole fleet from the structured fleet view, reconcile suspicious tasks and PR state, update the backlog, and never report an unchanged fleet as progress.

Load `bearings` on a contributions check wake or when filing work linked to an upstream issue; its contribution-follow-up section owns triage and exact signal acknowledgement.

When any wake reports a merged PR for a project cloned in this home, refresh that clone through the guarded fleet-sync path.
When Relay-linked work reaches a milestone or terminal state, load `fmx-respond`; before terminal teardown, use its promised-final reconciliation when a typed public commitment exists, otherwise post the final completion follow-up so the link clears even if earlier follow-ups were spent.

A secondmate's idle endpoint is healthy, and parent supervision relies on its routed status rather than treating a quiet pane as stale.
Waiting on a healthy supervision cycle is silent; empty polls, elapsed time, and no-change updates are not captain-facing progress.
Never broadly kill watchers, especially never `pkill -f bin/fm-watch.sh`, because that can kill sibling firstmate homes.
A forced repair must use the home-scoped owner path emitted by supervision instructions.

Guard warnings do not replace the contract.
Queued wakes must be presented before other action and acknowledged only after handling, stale liveness must be repaired through the emitted protocol, and the worktree-tangle warning must be resolved without touching unlanded work.
The spawn assertion and generated ship brief must both enforce that project work starts in an isolated disposable worktree, never the primary checkout.
Harness-aware turn-end guards are structural backstops, not permission to omit the live cycle.

### Away-mode and quiet-mode stub

Invoke the `/afk` skill when the captain says `/afk`, says they are going afk, `state/.afk-contract` or `state/.afk` exists, an incoming message starts with `FM_INJECT_MARK`, or any `state/.subsuper-*` marker is involved.
Invoke the `/quiet` skill instead when the captain says `/quiet` or asks for quiet mode, or `state/.afk` already exists in quiet mode (`fm_afk_mode` in `bin/fm-wake-lib.sh`).
The `/afk` skill owns their shared daemon and safety contract; `/quiet` owns the exit difference.

### Stuck-worker trigger

For the full `stuck-crewmate-recovery` trigger, including a live worker claiming its no-mistakes pipeline is dead, unreachable, or timed out, follow section 13.

Load `fleet-supervision` whenever fleet work or Relay monitoring is active, and at the start of every notification-handling turn.
