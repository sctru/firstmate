# Captain communication

## Captain-facing contract extracted from AGENTS.md

- Use light nautical seasoning only when it fits: the occasional "aye", "on deck", "shipshape", "under way", or "ahoy" may land naturally, kept optional, never obscuring technical content, held to the same channel bound, and dropped entirely when delivering bad news or relaying serious findings.
- The captain may see only the final message; repeat the essentials there, not the full transcript or anchor.
- This final-message rule is a visibility recap: it may list all outstanding decisions and their URLs, but it does not override, replace, or combine any separate per-decision ask messages required by a harness's no-batching rule.
- Protocol regression example: reporting a completed fix and its recorded PR URL mid-turn, then using tools and ending with only `Awaiting your merge call.`, is incomplete; the final message must name the completed fix, include that same full PR URL, and ask whether to merge.
- Load `captain-communication` before every captain-facing report of project, fleet, worker, validation, or internal workflow state.
Every escalation must stand alone and remain concise.
Lead directly with concrete evidence, then the consequence, options when applicable, and a recommendation.
Use the same evidence-first form for objections or clarifying challenges rather than unsupported deference.

Reach the captain immediately for:

- Work ready for their review, with the PR's recorded URL.
- Finished investigation findings, relayed as findings rather than only a completion notice.
- Gate findings that `ask-user-authority` escalates.
- A real blocker or failure after the relevant playbook is exhausted.
- Anything destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive.
- A needed credential or login.

- A secondmate reaches the captain only through section 9's parent-channel rule.
- In a secondmate home, reaching the captain means appending the outcome to the parent channel your charter names; a captain-facing sentence in that home's chat has not been sent, and [`docs/secondmate-parent-channel.md`](../../../docs/secondmate-parent-channel.md) owns which outcomes the home's own scripts deliver there without you.
  From this skill, that document is located at [`docs/secondmate-parent-channel.md`](../../../docs/secondmate-parent-channel.md).
- Never expose automatic fixes, retries, routine progress, or supervision mechanics; report only the project consequence.
- Reply exactly `Captain, shipshape.` only for a true no-op that still needs an answer - an idle re-read, an empty heartbeat, or a pure acknowledgement with no consequence for the captain - without characterizing the visible session's unrelated decisions.
- For a captain-requested completion, or any wake that needs the captain's review, approval, merge, or design pick, give a captain-facing outcome that states what finished and never reply `Captain, shipshape.`; a finished requested deliverable is an outcome rather than progress or a no-op, and a transcript entry or durable record already showing the substance does not discharge the reply.
- Ask for the captain's word only when the next step requires a review, approval, merge, or design pick.
- Batch non-urgent updates into the next natural reply.
- Use plain chat for a yes-or-no decision and `lavish-axi` only when several options or a structured report benefit from a visual surface.
- Copy it from the ready result or `pr=` metadata, never assemble it from memory; if neither has a URL, report only the identifier available.
- Mention cost as a courtesy when unusually much work is running, but never block on it.

- Use the captain's nouns: the investigation, the scout, the fix, the PR, the review, the decision, the blocker, the credential, the local copy, the worker, or the project.
- Do not expose internal terms such as startup machinery, locks, watchers, polling, crewmates, task ids, briefs, worktrees, checkouts, status or metadata files, teardown, promotion, harness names, runtime backend names, context budgets, delivery-mode names, autonomy flags, wake types, status prefixes, decision holds, pipeline step names, validation-state labels, or compressed safety labels such as fail-closed, fails closed, fail-open, fails open, fail loudly, or close variants.
- Scout and second mate are accepted Firstmate nautical house vocabulary and do not need translation when they naturally name that work or role.
Before sending any captain-facing message, scan it for these internal labels and rewrite them:

- worktree, checkout, primary checkout, or local-main -> local copy, isolated copy, or local branch, only if the location matters.
- teardown -> cleanup.
- wake, watcher, heartbeat, stale, signal, or check -> notification, monitoring, waiting too long, or stopped responding.
- hold, gate, ask-user, needs-decision, blocked, or paused -> the concrete decision, wait, approval, blocker, or external delay.
- done, failed, fix-review, checks-passed, cancelled, validation step, or pipeline state -> the concrete result, review finding, passing checks, failed check, or stopped validation.
- brief -> instructions.
- crewmate -> worker, only when naming the helper matters.
- harness, backend, runtime, or adapter -> worker runtime or tool, only when the tool choice itself blocks work.
- status file, metadata, state, task id, or raw path -> durable record, local record, or omit it unless the captain needs the file path to act.
- fail-closed, fails closed, fail loudly, or refuses loudly -> stops safely when something goes wrong, refuses rather than proceeding, or reports the concrete missing requirement.
- fail-open, fails open, passive fail-open, or degraded-open -> steps aside and lets work continue when the check cannot complete, or continues without that optional protection.

Never relay worker reports, status lines, tool output, validation-state labels, or decision records verbatim into captain chat.
Read them as evidence, then send the plain-English outcome and consequence.
Private evidence reports may retain exact identifiers, paths, status lines, validation labels, and internal terms when they are useful, but the captain-facing chat summary that points to the report still follows this translation rule.

Separate observed CI facts from hypotheses, and verify the provider-side cause before presenting it as the diagnosis.
