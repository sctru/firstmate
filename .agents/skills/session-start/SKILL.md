# Session start and recovery

## 3. Session start (run once at every session start)

Run `bin/fm-session-start.sh` exactly once at session start.
Its header is the single owner of composed commands, ordering, and digest contents.
`bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh` renders the emitted supervision block from `docs/supervision-protocols/`.
Do not reimplement it by separately running its lock, bootstrap, initial wake-drain, or deferred-network components.
Run-tier harness surfaces run this command for you at session open while the rest only nudge it, so confirm the digest is present in this session and run it yourself when it is not; `docs/sessionstart-nudge.md` owns adapter tiers, source routing, and compatibility.

Read the complete digest once and trust it as this turn's startup and recovery input.
If the harness shows only a preview and persists the full output to a file, read that file before acting.
Do not separately re-read the context, backlog, metadata, or bulk status inputs it just printed unless a source was reported absent or corrupt, older history is specifically needed, or a targeted workflow must inspect before writing.
An `ABSENT` captain, shared-captain, secondmate, or learnings file means the firstmate repo's built-in defaults, no shared captain preferences, no registered secondmates, or no captured learnings; rebuild an absent or stale project registry from the clones before dispatch.

If the session lock cannot be acquired and verified, report its exact diagnostic and remain read-only; another active session is only one possible cause.
A lock-refused session must not spawn, steer, merge, drain the wake queue, repair supervision, repair a checkout, or perform any other fleet mutation.

The digest itself makes no external-network call and never waits for one.
Every network check a session start owes - GitHub auth, dead-secondmate relaunch, secondmate convergence, pending handoff delivery, and project clone refresh - runs off the digest's blocking path in a bounded worker owned by `bin/fm-startup-network.sh` and is reported in the digest's own `NETWORK CHECKS` section.
The locked startup inactive-outcome scan joins that worker so a slow local current-state read cannot block the digest; its findings use the ordinary durable wake queue.
When that section reports its checks still in progress it names exactly what is unconfirmed; treat none of those as passed until `bin/fm-startup-network.sh report` returns the finished result, while a failed or otherwise actionable result also arrives as a `check: startup-network` wake.

1. **Lock** - acquires the per-home session lock first, before anything mutates shared state, then starts the deferred startup stage above.
2. **Bootstrap** - detect-only checks (tool/version problems, the worktree-tangle check, harness override, dispatch-profile validation, backlog-backend status) always run, but routine confirmations stay silent by default.
   When the lock could not be acquired, the worktree-tangle check uses read-only advisory wording without a checkout repair command.
   Home-local stale Herdr projection cleanup and the six bootstrap MUTATING sweeps - same-home backlog reconciliation, fleet sync, secondmate convergence, secondmate liveness, pending remote handoff retry, and Relay artifact writes - run only when this session actually holds the lock from step 1; the four network ones among them run in the deferred stage rather than in this section.
   The secondmate liveness sweep deterministically accounts for every registered secondmate: it relaunches only from the recovery-grade `dead` or `missing` states, preserves ambiguous, unreadable, or unreachable remote targets, and reports skipped or failed guarantees as `SECONDMATE_LIVENESS:` lines (`bin/fm-bootstrap.sh`; `bin/fm-backend.sh`'s `fm_backend_agent_state`; `docs/remote-secondmates.md`).
3. **Wake queue** - when locked, drains and presents the durable wake queue without running the inactive-outcome scan inline, and prints the raw records prominently as this turn's first work queue; a clearly labeled status-event annotation may follow a valid `signal` record and includes every status line still unread at the presentation cursor, but never replaces the raw record or current-state reconciliation, and a lapsed watcher chain still surfaces here via the same guard alarm.
   Presented records remain durable until the handling turn runs the generation-bound acknowledgement printed by the drain.
   Every locked drain also prints a bounded fleet-wide `OPEN DECISIONS` section when durable decision records remain open, including when the queue itself is empty; reconcile those entries before continuing.
   A main drain may also print a bounded, one-shot `STATUS OUTCOME BACKSTOP` when a task's newest captain-facing status event has no covering supervision-branch outcome; handle it as a recovered wake even when no queue row remains.
   The same drain prints every still-unread `note:` line and pending-reply resolution since the last presentation in an unbounded `UNREAD STATUS` section, so an answer buried under a later routine line is not dropped; those lines are not re-printed after that presentation.
   It also prints a bounded `RECORD DIVERGENCE` section naming every captain call the status log reads as resolved while its backlog task is still held; nothing is closed for you, and `captain-hold-lifecycle` owns the reconciliation.
   When the lock could not be acquired and verified, the queue is left untouched because no session mutation is authorized, and the guard's tangle/watcher-liveness alarms still print in read-only advisory mode without drain, supervision repair, or checkout repair commands.
4. **Supervision operating instructions** - after the wake queue and before both digests, the digest emits exactly one operating block for the detected primary harness, followed by the read-once contract that governs them.
   The script itself never starts supervision; the emitted harness protocol owns the exact wait or wake mechanism.
5. **Fleet-state digest** - after that read-once contract and ahead of the context digest, the compact backlog listing owned by `bin/fm-session-start.sh`; every `state/<id>.meta`; a bounded tail of each task's `state/<id>.status` (labeled as wake-EVENT history, not current state, with the full log path printed for a deeper read); the away posture (`state/.afk-contract`, plus the `state/.afk` daemon flag where a daemon runs); and one cheap alive/dead read of each task's recorded backend endpoint.
   That liveness line is a fast presence check only, not a full state read - when you need a crew's actual current state (a run-step, not just "is the pane there"), read it with `bin/fm-crew-state.sh <id>` as before; the digest deliberately skips that deeper, slower read for every task so it stays fast and bounded.
6. **Network checks** - after the fleet-state digest, the deferred stage's result, or an explicit statement of what it has not confirmed yet.
   A read-only session runs no network checks at all and says so.
7. **Context digest and next step** - last of the bulk sections, the full contents of `data/projects.md`, `data/secondmates.md`, `data/captain.md`, `data/captain-shared.md`, and `data/learnings.md`, each clearly delimited, followed by the closing reminder.
   A file that does not exist prints an explicit `ABSENT` marker, never confused with an empty-but-present file: absence is meaningful (`captain.md` absent means use the firstmate repo's built-in defaults, `projects.md` absent means rebuild it from the clones under `projects/`, etc.).
   The closing reminder points back to the emitted supervision block and preserves only the lock, afk, Relay, and read-once reminders.

- Bootstrap detects first, asks for consent, and installs only after the captain approves in the current session.
- Do not dispatch until the essential launch tools are present and GitHub authentication is good; presentation availability follows `bootstrap-diagnostics` and does not block nonvisual work.
- Use `gh-axi` for GitHub, `chrome-devtools-axi` for browser work, and compatible `lavish-axi` for visual decisions or reports; consult current help rather than memorizing flags.
- A silent bootstrap section needs no action; for any printed actionable diagnostic line, load `bootstrap-diagnostics` and follow its owner procedure.
- `BOOTSTRAP_INFO:` lines are completed no-action facts and do not require loading a skill.
- `secondmate-provisioning` owns startup secondmate sync, liveness, and inherited local-material convergence.

## 5. Recovery

After the one session-start digest, reconcile reality with durable records before taking new work.
Honor lock-refused read-only mode exactly as section 3 requires.
Treat digest status tails as wake-event history and use targeted current-state reconciliation when the live state matters.

Reconcile only this home's recorded direct reports and their recorded backend inventory; never sweep a shared endpoint namespace for matching names or claim another home's work.
For an ordinary direct report whose endpoint is dead or metadata has no window, load `stuck-crewmate-recovery` and preserve the recorded worktree and unlanded work while reconciling ownership.
For a dead secondmate direct report, load `secondmate-provisioning` and reconcile only that secondmate, never its whole child tree from the main home.
Each secondmate reconciles work already in its own home and then idles; recovery never authorizes it to invent work.

If `state/.afk` is present, load `/afk` in away mode or `/quiet` in quiet mode (`bin/fm-wake-lib.sh`'s `fm_afk_mode`); where its daemon runs, let the daemon own supervision rather than arming another cycle, and on Pi keep the ordinary supervision session, which runs in both postures with main parked while the record exists.
Surface only captain-relevant decisions, review-ready PRs, failures, and credential needs; otherwise resume the emitted supervision protocol silently.
A restart must be a non-event because durable state and live backend inventory, not conversation memory, are authoritative.

Load `session-start` at every Firstmate session start; it owns the one-shot startup, lock/read-only boundary, digest handling, and restart recovery.
