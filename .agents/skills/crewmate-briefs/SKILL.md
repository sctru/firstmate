# Crewmate briefs

`bin/fm-brief.sh` and its help own scaffold syntax, generated variants, status protocol, delivery-mode definitions of done, and exact safety mechanics.
Use its scaffold as the contract, then fill `## Captain's intent` (`{TASK}`) with the captain's own ask and any boundary the captain stated, plus the context needed to read it, including the substance of any report, decision, or PR the ask refers to; never widen the ask there into a general goal or an enumerated coverage list, because the reviewer treats that subsection as acceptance criteria.
Fill `## Firstmate spec` (`{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}`) with only the build instructions that ask requires, naming what stays out of scope when the ask is narrow; a generalization, consistency sweep, or extra hardening the captain did not ask for is follow-up work to note, not scope to add.
`bin/fm-dod-lib.sh` owns intent authoring without added speaker labels or direct address, its provenance markers, what a no-mistakes worker may pass as `--intent`, and the string's self-sufficiency rule.
Keep additions task-specific rather than repeating lifecycle instructions, and alter generated sections only when the task genuinely differs from the standard shape.

Every ship brief must retain the worktree-isolation assertion and stop if launched in the primary checkout.
Before a worker creates its task branch, its instructions must name the repository's local target branch and require rebasing the disposable copy onto it.
If a ship task touches firstmate's shared tracked material, explicitly require `firstmate-coding-guidelines` before editing.
If a task will drive Herdr lifecycle behavior, scaffold with `--herdr-lab`; if that need appears after an unguarded scaffold, stop and regenerate rather than adding commands by hand.
The generated Herdr contract must use a named non-`default` isolated lab and its guarded helper for every lifecycle action.

Load `secondmate-provisioning` before creating or using a charter brief and preserve its idle-by-default and marked-return-channel contracts.
Status appends are sparse supervisor-actionable events, not routine progress; `bin/fm-classify-lib.sh` owns keyed open and resolved semantics.
The scaffold is a safety contract, not a suggestion.

Load `crewmate-briefs` before creating or updating a ship, scout, or charter brief.
