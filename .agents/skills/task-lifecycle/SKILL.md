## 7. Task lifecycle

The delivery lifecycle is an always-loaded operational contract; referenced scripts own exact commands, flags, and data mechanics.

### Intake and authority

Resolve the project independently for every request.
An explicit project wins, a clear follow-up inherits its referent, and otherwise match the request against the registry, work under way, and project code or README.
Proceed on one confident match while naming the project in plain language; ask one concise question when multiple or no projects plausibly match.

Route by the nature of the work against each registered secondmate scope, not by a non-exclusive clone list.
Keep `local-only` work in the main home.
Send in-scope work to the fitting secondmate unless it is blocked or the captain explicitly redirects it; do not read the secondmate's chat because marked routed replies return through its status or referenced document.
If no secondmate scope fits, use the main home or discuss creating an appropriate persistent secondmate.
For one-off or infrequent operational work, start with the simplest direct end-to-end path.
Do not build wrappers, control planes, policy layers, custom verifiers, or automation unless the direct path exposes a concrete blocker or repeated need that justifies the added machinery.

Before commissioning an investigation, consult existing reports and established evidence.
Classify the deliverable:

- **Ship** is the default and produces a project change through the selected delivery mode; once implementation is authorized, dispatch a ship and keep any remaining bounded research inside it unless unresolved uncertainty could materially change whether or what to build.
- **Scout** produces knowledge in `data/<id>/report.md`, never a PR, and is appropriate for investigation, diagnosis, planning, reproduction, or audit work when the captain explicitly requests a separate knowledge or design deliverable or unresolved uncertainty could materially change whether or what to build.

If established evidence already answers an informational question, relay it without a design-only scout; when implementation intent is unclear, answer and ask one concise implementation question when useful rather than dispatching speculative design work.
Never both present a likely-enough solution and launch a parallel design exercise that is not expected to change it.
A diagnostic request, report, recommendation, or implementation-ready finding is evidence, not authorization to change code.
Load `diagnostic-reasoning` before scoping a reported bug and before acting on a diagnostic report.

Resolve every ship task's concrete delivery mode and `yolo` merge posture at intake.
Pass the mode explicitly to the brief, and pass both values explicitly to the spawn and any scout promotion; each command refuses to guess the values it consumes.
A current explicit captain instruction wins; otherwise the project's registry entry is the captain's standing posture, and dropping below its rigor needs a reason you can state.
On a `no-mistakes-prod-only` project, classify the task's surface: internal-only tooling, automation, contributor or operator process, and release or submission work ships `direct-PR`, while product-facing, mixed, and uncertain work ships `no-mistakes`; never infer internal-only from file location or project name.
An unregistered project or absent registry resolves to `no-mistakes` with yolo off, and the registration gap goes to the captain.
Record the resulting mode, `yolo` merge posture, and the one-line reason for any deviation in the backlog item note.

Treat file or subsystem overlap as a risk signal rather than an automatic reason to wait, and dispatch isolated work immediately with no concurrency cap when each change can be independently implemented and validated and the selected delivery path can reconcile ordinary rebases or conflicts.
Serialize only for a true semantic dependency, shared mutable external state, incompatible concurrent migration, or another concrete condition that makes independent progress or reconciliation unsafe; same-file editing alone is insufficient, and genuine blockers remain durable.
Write the task-specific brief under section 11 before spawning.
Fill the task subsections according to section 11.

### Dispatch and supervision handoff

Supervise all live work under section 8.

### Selected delivery path and merge authority

Use the repository-provided `gh-axi` wrapper for every GitHub operation unless it lacks the required command, and record that exception.
The selected delivery path owns its own rigor.
When no-mistakes is selected, no-mistakes alone owns review, fixes, tests, documentation, push, PR, and CI; otherwise follow the faster path without adding an independent reviewer.
Never hold work outside no-mistakes for a manual clean verdict, stack serial manual reviews, or infer authority for one from security, architecture, or risk alone.
A separate review or audit is allowed only when the captain explicitly requests that deliverable or the authorized task is a knowledge-only review; one named question remains scoped to that question.
If fast-path risk needs more rigor, escalate whether to use no-mistakes instead of inventing a manual gate.
The path's worker, automated gates, and captain approval remain authoritative:

- **no-mistakes** runs the full pipeline through a PR, then waits for the configured merge authority.
- **direct-PR** has the worker push and open a PR without the no-mistakes pipeline, then waits for the configured merge authority.
- **local-only** has the worker stop with a clean ready branch, then waits for the configured merge authority before firstmate uses the guarded fast-forward merge path.


After the requested behavior and focused tests pass, do not modify unrelated files or investigate unrelated CI failures without explicit scope expansion.
Before reading an artifact referenced by a request, verify that the command targets the exact path the request identifies and explain any discrepancy.
Anchor every requested review diff and history inspection to the exact base commit supplied in the task, and report any discrepancy before assessing completeness.
Inspect the complete requested diff and acceptance context before producing a PR title or summary.
Load `task-lifecycle` for every software-work request before deciding whether to answer, investigate, or dispatch.
