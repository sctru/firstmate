# Ensure a project worktree follows the agent-memory file convention.
# AGENTS.md is the project-intrinsic knowledge file. Creates a minimal skeleton
# when it is absent, or copies the content of a sole real, non-pointer CLAUDE.md
# into AGENTS.md. Never creates or changes CLAUDE.md, including existing files
# and symlinks.
# Owns the canonical "## Maintaining this file" self-governance wording for
# project AGENTS.md files, injecting it idempotently into created skeletons,
# promoted CLAUDE.md files, and existing AGENTS.md files lacking both the exact
# heading and the project-owned mark below (exact first line, LF or CRLF):
# <!-- firstmate:maintained-by-project -->
# Projects may place this mark at the start of the file and retain equivalent
# maintenance guidance under their own heading. It declares guidance is present, not
# permission to remove governance. No prose equivalence is inferred.
# Recognizes the old two-line CLAUDE.md pointer only to avoid promoting it as
# project knowledge. Refuses a case-variant memory file such as lowercase
# agents.md, so AGENTS.md has the exact name on every filesystem (issue #389).
# This is a worktree utility for crewmates, not a supervision script, so it does
# not call fm-guard.sh.
# Usage: fm-ensure-agents-md.sh [repo-or-worktree-dir]

To retain equivalent project-owned maintenance guidance without adding the
canonical section, use this exact first line of AGENTS.md (LF or CRLF):
<!-- firstmate:maintained-by-project -->
The mark declares retained guidance, not permission to remove governance.
Without the first-line mark or exact canonical heading, the helper adds the section.
